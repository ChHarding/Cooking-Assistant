# Project Summary
The **Smart Cooking Assistant** is an AI-powered application designed to guide users through meal preparation while personalizing their cooking experience. The assistant adapts to each user’s preferences, skill level, and available kitchen tools, using an intelligent profiling system that evolves based on interactions. This project aims to create a tool that not only provides recipes but also enhances the user’s culinary skills by offering tailored suggestions, step-by-step guidance, and dynamic optimization of recipe plans. Whether the user is a novice cook, a parent managing dietary restrictions, or a caregiver navigating complex nutrition needs, the assistant learns and grows with each interaction to deliver an increasingly personalized experience.

Key to the assistant’s functionality is the creation of detailed user profiles. These profiles store information about food preferences, available ingredients, and kitchen tools, and are continuously updated through feedback during and after the cooking process. By leveraging the OpenAI ChatGPT API, the system uses machine learning models to analyze user inputs (both text and voice), extracting insights that further refine the profile. This allows the assistant to suggest recipes and tools that suit the user’s specific needs. The assistant can also connect with external apps, such as grocery trackers, to update profiles based on ingredient availability and provide real-time recipe suggestions based on what’s in the pantry.

The initial prototype will feature a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI) with text and speech input capabilities. Users will interact with the assistant conversationally, and while voice recognition is a long-term goal, it may be omitted in early versions. The assistant will display recipe instructions, ingredient lists, and other relevant data, all while maintaining a smooth, guided user experience. The prototype will rely on Python dicts stored as JSON files for profile management, although further research into scalable data storage (e.g., databases) is planned as the project progresses.

In addition to the OpenAI API for natural language processing, future versions may incorporate APIs for voice recognition and ingredient tracking. As the assistant grows, the focus will be on refining how user feedback is handled and how the assistant dynamically updates profiles in real time, ensuring that each cooking experience is optimized for the individual.

This project explores the boundaries of AI in daily life, particularly in the kitchen, where personalization can have a significant impact on user satisfaction and cooking efficiency. The ultimate goal is to create a system that not only improves the cooking process but also enhances the user’s confidence and knowledge over time.
